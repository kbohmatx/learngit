# In Git, pushing is the process of moving code from one repository to another one. Often this is used to move code from a local machine to a remote one, or to a repository hosting service like GitHub.

- Pushing a repository allows a programmer to maintain an easily accessible backup in a second location. It is also used when collaborating with people that would not have access to the computer.

# Syntax
- git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
