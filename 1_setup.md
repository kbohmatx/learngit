The initial set up in GIT is to associate a folder w/ a repository GIT.  The following are the common GIT commands to get you started:

git config:
    --list : show existing configuration items.  User/Email should be in the list.

git init: (this is for local use. see git clone for more common use.)
    The git init command is used to initialize a new Git repository. 
    
    note: The hidden .git folder that contains the data structors.
    note: To initialize an existing repo, the git clone is often preferred.

    example: git init

.gitignore:
    The git ignore file will exclude 

git clone: 
    The git clone command is used to create a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine. This command not only copies the files from the remote repository but also establishes a connection between your local copy and the original repository

    example: git clone [url] .
    
git config

git remote -v : lists info about the repo.

git branch -a : lists all the branches locally and remotely.
